    <AlertLowHemogenDesc>A colonist has low haemogen. At zero haemogen, they will develop a painful haemogen craving.\n\nFeed them haemogen packs to prevent this. You can obtain haemogen packs using the 'extract haemogen pack' medical operation on a non-haemogenic human.\n\nThe following colonists have low haemogen</AlertLowHemogenDesc>

    <HemogenDesc>Haemogen is a biological energy source derived from compounds in human blood. Baseliner humans produce it endogenously and consume it over time in their own internal balance. Some human xenotypes use it as a kind of fuel for specific abilities, while others must consume it to survive at all.</HemogenDesc>
